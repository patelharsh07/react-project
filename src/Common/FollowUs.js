            Dr. Mandel provided our teachers with strategies, techniques, and an
            abundance of knowledge to help them better understand the effects of
            stress on their lives and the lives of their students. She has
            provided our staff with the tools they need to build healthier lives
            and reduce stress. We are incredibly grateful for the work she has
            already done in our district and we hope to expand her expertise to
            our students in the near future.
