                    “There is no power in the world that can stop a firm
                    conviction” -D.R. Butler
                    <br />
                    Intention, in my humble opinion, is extremely underrated
                    and underutilized. I’m not exactly sure why. I have
                    experienced the power of utilizing conscious intention in my
                    life and for some reason still don’t use it all the time…
                    (we teach what we need to learn more of)
                    <br />
                    An easy way to discover your true intention is to pause…ask
                    yourself:
                    <br />
                    1. What do I want from this situation? Phone call?
                    Relationship? Meeting? I know this may sound too simple but
                    think of how many times you primed yourself with the
                    question “What do I really want out of X”. Believe it or
                    not, just that simple question is so helpful if done
                    beforehand! Not only do you get a few minutes to think about
                    it and organize the desire in your own head, but you get a
                    moment to breathe and recenter. Try to be as specific as
                    possible. “I want to find out what the rest of the team
                    thinks is necessary to make this project the most
                    effective”, or “I want to make sure this patient understands
                    the benefit of our new health plan”, or “I want to make sure
                    my son feels heard and understood on the way to school
                    today” One way to help is to restate to intention or
                    objective before beginning the call or meeting. Get to the
                    core of the intention first, and then, when you are
                    satisfied that it was met, you can end the meeting or
                    continue from there. Following your stated intention will
                    keep you organized and prioritizes your intention. (It saves
                    time as well!) Win-Win! I love those!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. Ask yourself WHY you want this outcome? Again, so simple
                    right? The reason for this is because sometimes we tend to
                    focus on what we want to avoid. There is a big difference in
                    how you will feel, and what you will accomplish depending on
                    where you put your focus. A quick example of this is INSTEAD
                    of saying “I want my business to be successful or else it
                    will be impossible to pay my bills” focus on the driving
                    force of your business. “I want my business to thrive so I
                    can touch as many lives as I can and save them the suffering
                    I went through. This will bring a new meaning and purpose to
                    your work and the results will follow. It’s like jet fuel.
                    It will get you to your desired results faster and with the
                    feeling of being inspired to succeed instead of being
                    motivated. In other words, it will be an internal force
                    pulling you towards your goal instead of an external force
                    pushing you to get it done. Try to think of the benefits
                    this project or business venture will add to other’s lives,
                    not just the means to pay the bills.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To sum things up, ask yourself daily with big and little
                    decisions,- What do I want, and why do I want it? Its
                    simple, its powerful and it may change your outcome in a way
                    that no other 5-10 minutes of preparation will! Try it, let
                    me know what happens!
